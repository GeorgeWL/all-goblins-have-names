# All Goblins Have Names

A module for Foundry VTT. Allows you to use a table as the Display Name for a token so each new
token will get a random name.

## How to use it

First, grab your random name table and drag it into a Journal entry. That will give you some
text that looks similar to `@RollTable[2cbm3cP46dxcxO5Z]{Dwarf Female Name}`. Now, open the Actor
and click Prototype Token. Paste your `@RollTable[...` text into the Token Name. When you drag your Actor
onto the map to create a new Token, its name will be randomized!
